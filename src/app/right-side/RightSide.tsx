                Currently, I'm a Senior Front-End Engineer at Klaviyo, specializing in accessibility.

                In the past, I've had the opportunity to develop software across a variety of settings — from advertising agencies and large corporations to start-ups and small digital product studios. Additionally, I also released a comprehensive video course a few years ago, guiding learners through building a web app with the Spotify API.

                In my spare time, I’m usually climbing, reading, hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running around Hyrule searching for Korok seeds.
